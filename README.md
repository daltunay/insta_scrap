Automated data scraping from Instagram for profile analysis

This is an ongoing project. As of now, the algorithm is able to fetch all the usernames and the corresponding profile pictures of people who liked a specific post, or a specific page (news outlet). Then, it used Google Cloud Vision to detect the content of each profile picture (number of human faces, animals, etc.)

The next step is to run the algorithm a few days a week to build a huge database, and then operate some statistical analysis and user clustering based on the profile picture content and the liked pages/posts.
